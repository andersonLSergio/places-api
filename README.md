# places-api

This API is designed to serve location interest points as well as properties related to that, 
like photos about that place, reviews, comments, and more...

# Goal

The main goal of this project is to improve my Python/Django skills by using these technologies on an API perspective, 
so it can be used for future projects like Mobile Apps and Websites.
